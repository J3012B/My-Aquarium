 Hey, please be free and adjust the following values as you like. You can also interact with the objects by dragging and touching. It's an aquarium. It's your aquarium, so explore!

 ### I'm sooo lonely here!
 No fish should be left alone. Put more fishes in there so that **Goldie** isn't so lonely anymore. Do this by adding more names. You also have to decide what type of fish you want to have in your little aquarium. There are 6 different types of fishes you can choose from, just type a number from 1 to 6. You can also add multiple fishes of one type.

 Have you already tried to interact with the objects? This sculpture for example looks a bit creepy.
